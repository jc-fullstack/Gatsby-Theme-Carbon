<PageDescription>

When building sites using the Carbon Gatsby Theme, there are a number of
different ways you can host your site. While the Carbon team does not have an
opinionated stance on how you host your projects, these are some resources
others have found helpful for hosting.

## GH Pages

For external sites, you can use [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) on public
Github to build your site. For internal sites, the CIO provides
[Github Enterprise](https://w3.ibm.com/help/#/article/github_ent_ibm/github_overview?requestedTopicId=github_overview)
to IBMers while working with IBM intellectual property. This tool is accessible
by any IBMer. Regardless of whether your projects is external or internal, check
out the guide below from Gatsby to allow your site to work with GH Pages.
